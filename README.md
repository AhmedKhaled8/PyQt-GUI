Here are the GUIs of the Tasks/Projects I worked on in College:
1. [Image Components Mixer](https://github.com/AhmedKhaled8/ImageComponentsMixer) : The GUI mixes 2 compatable components of 2 images (real of image 1 and imaginary of image 2, magnitude of image 1 and phase of image 2) to generate a new image. 2 output images can be simulataneously generated.
2. [JPEG Decoder](https://github.com/AhmedKhaled8/JPEG-Decoder) : The progressive JPG images when loading in websites uploads in .. well "progressive" way. The GUI show 8 stages of the decoding process and how would the image appear in every stage of the 8 stages.
3. [Audio Sepearator](https://github.com/AhmedKhaled8/Audio-Separator) : The GUI separate a loaded song into the vocals of the singers and the music. Also there's a mode where you can separate different instruments of a party.
4. [Music Equalizer](https://github.com/AhmedKhaled8/MusicEqualizer) : It's a mediaplayer and an equalizer. You can modify the contribution of 10 frequency bands (up to 22KHz) and show the result as plotting in time and frequency domains. The modified audio file can be saved as .wav file and you can play it in the application's mediaplayer or any other player.
